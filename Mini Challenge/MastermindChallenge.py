# The player enters 4 numbers, and the computer tells the player how many (but not which) of the 4 numbers are correct.

# Here’s an example game output:
#
# ----MASTERMIND----
# Guess the 4 numbers in as few tries as possible
#
# 1> 1442
# *
# 2> 2443
#
# 3> 1321
# *
# 4> 1214
# **
# 5> 1134
# ****
# Well done... That took you [5] attempts!
