# Just to clarify, youâ€™re not creating a mediocre calculator, but a program for calculating averages.
#
# The user should be able to enter a series of numbers, and the program should print the average of these numbers. You can use floating point number variables, or store the input in a list.
#
# Your program might be used to calculate average temperatures for a week, or a batting average for a cricket team, among others. You could even expand the program to print the mean, median and mode averages.
