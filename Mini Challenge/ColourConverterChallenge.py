# When making websites, one way of thinking about different colours is by their ‘RGB’ values. RGB stands for Red, Green and Blue. Every colour can be ‘made’ by combining different amounts of Red, Green and Blue. Each part of the colour has a value between 0 and 255. Here are some examples:
#
# (255, 0, 0) = RED
# This is a colour made up of ‘full’ red, and no green or blue. This makes red.
#
# (0, 139, 139) = TEAL
# This is a colour made up of no red, and some green and blue. This makes teal.
#
# Another way of representing colour is by a hexadecimal code. This is the same RGB combination, but with 2 hex digits (00 – FF) representing each or the three component colours:
#
# #FF0000 = RED
# #008B8B = TEAL
#
# Write a program to convert from a decimal RGB colour code to its hexadecimal code equivalent.
