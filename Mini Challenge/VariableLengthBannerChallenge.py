# Right at the start of these tutorials, we wrote what you’d probably now consider to be a very simple program to print a banner of someone’s name. It probably produced output like this:
#
# ------------
# .::Xephos::.
# ------------
#
# The trouble is, it probably sometimes looked like this:
#
# ------------
# .::TJ::.
# ------------
#
# …or this…
#
# ------------
# .::Christopher Thompson III::.
# ------------
#
# Make a banner program that fits the banner around the user’s name, like these lovely examples:
#
# ******   ****************************
# * TJ *   * Christopher Thompson III *
# ******   ****************************
